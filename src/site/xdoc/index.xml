    <section name="Hippo CMS External Document Picker Base">
      <p>
        This project provides base external document picker plugins for Hippo CMS 7 with simple example implementations for developer's references.
      </p>
      <p>
        This plugin module allows developers to define their own domain specific models to search/select external document(s).
        Developers can simply use this forge module plugin class and configurations
        with injecting their own <code>org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.api.ExternalDocumentServiceFacade</code> implementation class.
      </p>
      <p>
        For detail, please see <a href="architecture.html">Architecture</a> and <a href="dev-howto.html">Developers How-to</a> pages.
