    <section name="Hippo CMS External Document Picker Base">
      <p>
        This project provides base external document picker plugins for Hippo CMS with simple example implementations for developer's references.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project consists of two different external document pickers: 
        one for <a href="field/architecture.html">External Document Field Picker</a> 
        and the other for <a href="richtext-ckeditor/architecture.html">External Link Picker Button in the RichText Editor</a>.
      </p>
      <subsection name="External Document Field Picker">
        <p>
          External Document Field Picker allows developers to define their own domain specific models to search/select
          external document(s) for a field of a CMS document.
          Developers can simply use this forge module plugin class and configurations
          with injecting their own 
          <a href="apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/exdocpicker/api/ExternalDocumentServiceFacade.html" target="_blank">org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.api.ExternalDocumentServiceFacade</a>
          implementation class.
        </p>
        <p>
          External Document Field Picker may show either <strong><i>Flat List View</i></strong> or
          <strong><i>Tree List View</i></strong> for the backend data
          in the picker dialog, depending on configurations and implementations.
          If you want to show a <strong><i>Tree List View</i></strong> in the picker dialog instead of the default
          <strong><i>Flat List View</i></strong>, you need to use slightly
          different plugin configurations and your 
          <a href="apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/exdocpicker/api/ExternalDocumentServiceFacade.html" target="_blank">org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.api.ExternalDocumentServiceFacade</a>
          implementation class must implement the three more operations defined in
          <a href="apidocs/org/onehippo/forge/exdocpicker/api/ExternalDocumentTreeService.html" target="_blank">org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.api.ExternalDocumentTreeService</a>
          additionally, in order to provide hierarchical information resolutions on the searched external backend data.

        <p>
          This plugin module allows developers to define their own domain specific models to search/select external document(s)
          in RichText Editor (CKEditor) fields through your own REST Services.
          Developers can simply add this forge module dependency and add extra CKEditor module configurations for RichText editor configuration(s).

    <section name="Testing External Document Field Picker with Demo Application">
      <p>

      <img src="images/exdocpickerbase-screenshot-01.png" alt="Edit News Article" />
      <p>
        If you edit the document, then you will be able to click on 'Browse...' button for each field to see the following popup dialog.
        You can search and browse your domain specific external documents there based on your service class implementation.
        If you select external document(s) and click on the OK button, then the field will be set to those selected external documents.
      </p>
      <img src="images/exdocpickerbase-screenshot-02.png" alt="Search and Browse External Documents" />
      <p>
        If a field is configured to support <strong><i>Tree List View</i></strong> picker dialog mode, then
        the plugin may show a tree list view like the following on 'Browse...' button clicked.
        You can expand or collapse your domain specific external tree data there based on your service class implementation.
        If you select external tree item(s) and click on the OK button, then the field will be set to those selected external documents.
