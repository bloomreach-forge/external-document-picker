      <p>
        This project provides base external document picker plugins for Hippo CMS 7 with simple example implementations for developer's references.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project consists of two different external document pickers: 
        one for <a href="field/architecture.html">External Document Field Picker</a> 
        and the other for <a href="richtext-ckeditor/architecture.html">External Link Picker Button in the RichText Editor</a>.
      </p>
      <subsection name="External Document Field Picker">
        <p>
          External Document Field Picker allows developers to define their own domain specific models to search/select external document(s)
          for a field of a CMS document.
          Developers can simply use this forge module plugin class and configurations
          with injecting their own

      <subsection name="External Link Picker Button in RichText Editor">
        <p>
          This plugin module allows developers to define their own domain specific models to search/select external document(s)
          in RichText Editor (CKEditor) fields through your own REST Services.
          Developers can simply add this forge module dependency and add extra CKEditor module configurations for RichText editor configuration(s).
