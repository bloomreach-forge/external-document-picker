        <ul>
          <li>
            Bug fix: in single selection mode,
            <code>ExternalDocumentFieldService.setFieldExternalDocuments(ExternalDocumentServiceContext, ExternalDocumentCollection&lt;Serializable&gt;)</code>
            with the last selected item.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hide [Select All] and [Clear All] buttons in single selection mode.

      <subsection name="2.0.9">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Supporting [Select All] and [Clear All] buttons in the picker dialog.
          </li>
          <li>
            More flexibility for custom plugins by:
            (a) allowing to set/get/remove attributes in ExternalDocumentServiceContext for custom plugins to be able to store ad hoc data,
            and (b) supporting Cloneable for ExternalDocumentCollection to allow custom plugins to be able to clone
            the current external document selection before passing it to dialog (which can modify the selection).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="2.0.8">
        <ul>

            Supporting abstract base plugin class (org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.impl.field.AbstractHiddenExternalDocumentFieldPlugin)
            which can be used to add a hidden field plugin to update some other properties under the hood.
            Please see org.onehippo.forge.exdocpicker.demo.field.DateUpdatingHiddenFieldPlugin class and its configuration
            in the news document namespace in the demo project for detail. That example simply updates the date field
            whenever editing the news document.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Usability improvements:

              b) Item can be selected by clicking on any column in the row.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extensibility improvements:
              a) Dialog component can be extended for UI by using Wicket extension mechanism,
