        This feature is available since v7.0.0. See <a href="../release-notes.html">Release Notes</a> for detail.

      <subsection name="Overview">
        <p>
          In Hippo CMS authoring application, the <strong>OpenUI External Document Picker Base for Field Picker</strong>
          plugin is installed.
          Then you can configure field(s) in document template bootstrap files (a.k.a Hippo CMS 'namespace').
          So, when you are editing a document in CMS authoring application,
          you will see those being displayed by this plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CMS built-in <code>OpenUiStringPlugin</code> loads the built-in
          <a href="https://documentation.bloomreach.com/14/library/concepts/open-ui/introduction.html">OpenUI Extension</a>
          located at <code>angular/exdocpickerbase-openui/index.html</code>
          (e.g, <code>http://localhost:8080/cms/angular/exdocpickerbase-openui/index.html</code>)
          in its embedded IFrame.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a user selects an item and clicks on the OK button in the picker dialog,
          the dialog returns the selection and the built-in OpenUI Extension stores the ID of the selected item
          for the field through the OpenUI Extension API.
          See <a href="https://documentation.bloomreach.com/14/library/concepts/open-ui/open-ui-dialogs.html">Use Open UI Dialogs</a> for further details.

          Here's an architectural overview. As you can see, you can care of only your <code>Custom REST Services</code>
          with simple configurations for a specific document field without having to spend
          much effort on CMS Document Editor UI customization by yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your <code>Custom REST Services</code> implemention should follow
          <a href="spec-of-rest-services.html">Specification of REST Services for OpenUI Document Field Picker</a>
          as the build-in OpenUI Extension plugin expects the specific JSON format in responses.
